           <p>With a grand sens of adventure, Charles and Ray Eames turned their curiusely and boundless enthusiasm into creations that established them as truly great husband and life design team. Their umique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture. lean and modern. playful and functional. sleek, sophisticated and beautifuly simple. That was and is the "Eames look".</p>
           <img src="img/chair1.png" alt="side view of chair">

           <p>That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded playwood chairs in the late 1940s and included the world-renowned Eames loung chair, now in the permanent colletion of the mesuem of Modern in New York </p>

           <p>Charles and Ray acheived their monumental success by approaching each project the same way: does it interest and intrigue us?can we better?</P>

            <p class="personal-quote">Choose your corner, pick away at it carfully, intensely &amp; to teh best of your ability, &amp; that way, you might change the world" <br> <span> Charles Eames</span></p>

            <p>The loved tehir work, which was a combination of art science, design and architecture, process and product". that they did.tsat also made it a lot more intersting.</p>

            <div class="img-wrap">
                <img src="img/chair2.png" alt="font view of chair">
                <img class="img-right" src="img/chair3.png" alt="under view of chair">
                <img class="img-right" src="img/chair4.png" alt="under view of chair">
            </div>

            <p>Their own concept evolved over time, not overniht. As Charles noted about the devolpement of the Moulded Playwood Chairs, "Yes, it was a flash of insperation", he said, "a kind of 30-year flash".</p>

            <p>A design critic ounce said that this extraordinary couple "just want to make the world a better place". That they did. Tsat also made it a lot more intresting.</p>
